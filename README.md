Evaporation Cooling System (Swamp Cooler)

Designed and built an Arduino-based evaporation cooling system that monitors temperature, humidity, and water levels to control a fan motor and adjust vent direction. The system features multiple operational states like IDLE, RUNNING, ERROR, and DISABLED, depending on sensor input. Key features include:

    Integration of a real-time clock to track motor activity and state changes.
    LCD display for system updates and notifications.
    Stepper motor control for adjusting vent angles based on user inputs.
    Error detection for low water levels or out-of-range temperatures.

The system was developed using various Arduino libraries for motor control, LCD displays, clock modules, and sensor integration. I applied concepts of embedded system design, focusing on direct register manipulation for ADC sampling and interrupt-driven input for control.
